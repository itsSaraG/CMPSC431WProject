Here is the import and connection to my db.  

What I did was, take my CSV files and manually import them into the database. In GitHub, I have provided all my CSV files along with a .SQL file which I got from PG admin.  

With this, I used VS code to set up my connection as seen above, and the .py file should then connect to the database and be able to run the CLI correctly.  

Run the program and you should see the CLI pop up and follow the directions on the CLI on how to manipulate the data.
